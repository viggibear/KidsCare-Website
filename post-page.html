                <p>Traditional wisdom always implied that effective parenting employed hitting your child to correct their behaviour. After all, no other form of discipline can lay claim to being able to elicit such a quick change in the child's behaviour. But are we missing the bigger picture in this problem by heeding this advice? </p>

                <p>Before we move on, let's define what corporal punishment is. Corporal punishment sounds like a big scary term but it’s really quite simple. Corporal punishment is defined by (who) as punishment intended to cause physical pain to the intended person to elicit an immediate change in behaviour and in the hopes of preventing the behaviour from reoccurring in the future. Forms of corporal punishment specifically in children are usually smacking, spanking, slapping or using an object such as slippers or a rod to hit the child and to force a change so as to not repeat the "wrong" action. Think about an angry mum using a coat hanger to slap her child on the wrist for every question he/she gets wrong on a test or a disgruntled father forcing his kid to kneel on hard ground for forgetting to do the dishes.</p>

                <p>At first, corporal punishment might seem to have no effect, or even have a beneficial one, on the child. After all, many parents say that they’ve tried everything and that their little brat only cuts it out after getting a tight slap on his cheek but that’s like setting your house on fire in winter and saying, “LOOK, it’s keeping me warm”. But you still have a burning house. Corporal punishment is that burning house. Maybe your child will immediately change his behaviour to avoid getting hurt further but the match has been lit, it can have big ripple effects that can be severely detrimental to his development. </p>

                <p>What’s worse is that in Singapore, corporal punishment is pretty commonplace and sometimes it even leads to A&E visits when things get out of hand. What started out with good intentions can devolve into a show of force, leading to lesions, burns, cuts and fractures. Extensive research has been done on how physical discipline affects children and the results show a general consensus that it can lead to later problems, including aggression and acting-out episodes. Also, these studies have also found no benefit in hitting their children in any circumstance. That's right, <b>0.</b> </p>

                <p>Even then, why do parents keep resorting to this form of discipline? Several impediments to change help explain why parents continue to practice corporal punishment. First, many remain unaware of the sizable body of evidence showing the damage it can cause in child development. Second, although corporal punishment is clearly not a good way to discipline children, we need evidence for effective alternatives. We also need to communicate better with parents about how they can discipline children without resorting to physical punishment. Parents often discipline children physically because they mistakenly believe that it will improve their behaviour and that it does no long-term harm.</p>
